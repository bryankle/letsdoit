- Reroute DB to correct location to ensure application functions
- Add task with query and live render when task is added to database

Question
- Can I add to the tasks in the database by querying the database directly and associating that with a Redux action?
- Or make a POST http request

- UpstarMusic sample imports database queries into actions and nests return functions

// Will work differently when implementing user login function
// Will not grab user task data until login is successful
// Create more routes for specific users and tasks
// Add PUT, POST, GET, and DELETE

- STUDY JUKE BACKEND FOR PUT POST GET AND DELETE
- MAP OUT USER LOGIN TO TASK LOAD
- REDUX WILL ONLY BE USED FOR HOLDING ONTO DATA 
- action used to perform API fetching


- Make user page for routes with GET POST PUT AND DELETE
- /api/userid/tasks to retrieve all tasks
- /api/userid/tasks/taskid to retrieve specific task
- use axios on actions to reference api routes
- what is the payload?
- maybe API payload is always tasks

-GOAL FOR TOMORROW
- create routes with mock user and API requests from new routes 
- then link redux actions to backend routes with axios
